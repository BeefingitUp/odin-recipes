    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</li>
        <li>
            Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. 
            Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. 
            Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
            Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. 
            Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.
        </li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375F, or 190C</li>
        <li>
            To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. 
            Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. 
            Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. 
            Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. 
            Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.
        </li>
        <li>
            Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. 
            Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
        </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Dig in, but be careful, it's probably very hot, so wait a few minutes!</li>
