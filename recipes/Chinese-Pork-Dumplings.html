    <ol>
        <li>
            To make the dipping sauce: Combine soy sauce, rice vinegar, chives, sesame seeds, 
            and chile-garlic sauce in a small bowl. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            To make the dumplings: Mix pork, garlic, egg, chives, soy sauce, sesame oil, and ginger 
            in a large bowl until thoroughly combined.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place a dumpling wrapper on a lightly floured work surface and spoon about 1 tablespoon of filling in the middle.
        </li>
        <li>
            Wet the edge with a little water and crimp together forming small pleats to seal the dumpling. 
            Repeat to form remaining dumplings.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat 1 to 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. 
            Place 8 to 10 dumplings in the pan and cook until browned, about 2 minutes per side.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour in 1 cup of water; cover and cook until dumplings are tender and pork is cooked through, about 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Repeat to cook remaining dumplings, adding more oil and water for each batch.
        </li>
        <li>
            Dig in! (And don't forget the dipping sauce, it makes the dumplings 5 times better.)
